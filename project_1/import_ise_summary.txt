* The report is divided into following three sections:-

*  This section provides the details of the ISE project that was imported
*
* Section (2) - EXCEPTIONS
*
*  This section summarizes the ISE project data that was either not imported or

*
* Section (3) - MAPPED DATA
*
*  This section summarizes the PlanAhead project information that was imported
*  from the ISE project data

Section (1) - ISE PROJECT INFORMATION
-------------------------------------

The following items describes the information about the ISE project that was imported:-

Project Name    = LR4
Project File    = D:/intelFPGA/18.1/Lab_Verilog/LR4/LR4.xise
Project Version = 14.7
Device Family   = 
Part Name       = -*

*This part is not supported in PlanAhead and is replaced with the default part in the new project.
 Please see Section (3.1) - "Target Device" below for more details.


Section (2) - EXCEPTIONS
------------------------

The following sub-sections describes the list of items that were NOT mapped from the
XISE file contents into the current project:-

Section (2.1) - Missing Sources
-------------------------------
None


Section (2.2) - Unknown Sources
-------------------------------
None


Section (2.3) - IP Import Issues
--------------------------------
None


Section (2.4) - Unknown Properties
----------------------------------

The following ISE properties were not mapped into the current project:-


<ISE Property Name>              <ISE Property Value>
"Manual Compile Order"           'false'
"VHDL Source Analysis Standard"  'VHDL-93'
"Enable Message Filtering"       'false'


Section (3) - MAPPED DATA
-------------------------

The following sub-sections describes the list of items that were imported from the
ISE properties and sources and mapped into the current project:-

Section (3.1) - Target Device
-----------------------------

Default Part = xc7vx485tffg1157-1
Family       = virtex7
Package      = ffg1157
Speed Grade  = -1


Section (3.2) - Filesets
------------------------

<sources_1>
FILESET_TYPE   = DesignSrcs
TOP            = 
DESIGN_MODE    = RTL
VERILOG_DIR    = 
VERILOG_DEFINE = 
VHDL_GENERICS  = 

File(s):-
None

<constrs_1>
FILESET_TYPE   = Constrs

Note: During the import operation, any constraint file(s) that are found in the ISE project will be added to the current PlanAhead project.
      However, please note that none of these files will be automatically marked as a "Target Constraint File". To set a constraint file
      as target, select the file in the GUI "Sources" window, right-click on this file and then select "Set Target UCF". Alternatively,
      the target constraint file can be set using the "set_property target_constrs_file <filename> <fileset>" Tcl command.
